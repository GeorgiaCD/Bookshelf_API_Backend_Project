## Description

This project is an online bookshelf where users can keep a track of their books they have on the bookshelf. The bookshelf represents the relationship between the user and a book on their list. This is our to-do list.

Each book contains information about that book such as the author, title, genre, year it was released and number of pages and the bookshelf item has status and rating. The status has 3 options, "Want to read", "Currently Reading" and "Read". The user also has the option to rate the book out of 10.

The program can add new books and then assign the book to a user. This new book will now be added to the users bookshelf which acts like a collection of books.

The user also has the ability to filter their bookshelf by the following options: genre, author id, year, length and status.

MVP:
- Add an book to the users bookshelf (List<books_users>)
- Display all books from library
- Display all books in the bookshelf
- Update a book status on your bookshelf
- Delete an item from bookshelf
- Filter items on your bookshelf by properties
You can see a visual representaion of how it all comes together through the UML, ERD and a description of the classes.

### Models
<hr />

### Author (AuthorDTO)

### Book   (BookDTO)
### User   (UserDTO)
### Bookshelf (BookshelfDTO, UserBookshelfDTO)

A bookshelf object contains a bookId, userId, status and rating. The naming does not imply a List but rather the relation between a user and book in terms of the status and rating given. Bookshelf items can be filtered by userId and the status. The status and rating can be updated through the relative bookshelfId and PATCH routes. The BookshelfDTO is used to add a new Bookshelf to the repository (POST) and the UserBookshelfDTO is used to format the information from a bookshelf object to the front end (GET) for clarity when retrieving a user's bookshelf items.

NOTE: in the API, we use the plural bookshelves when referring to a List of bookshelf items. e.g. when referencing a user's "bookshelf" full of books, we name it bookshelves.

### Status  (StatusDTO)
### Genres

### RatingDTO

The rating is a property of the bookshelf item rather than the book as each user can review the book and give their rating for it. There is no rating object, however there is a RatingDTO to pass in a JSON body to update the rating for a specific bookshelf item.
